        <h3>Rapid Software Development</h3>
        <img src="asset:assets/images/banner/RAD.jpg">
        <p>- Rapid development and delivery is now often the most important requirement for software systems.</p>
  
        <br>
  
        <h3>Agile Development</h3>
        <img src="asset:assets/images/banner/AGILE.jpg">
        <p>- The system is developed as a series of versions or increments with stakeholders involved in version specification and evaluation.</p>
  
        <br>
        <br>
  
        <h3>Plan Driven Development</h3>
        <img src="asset:assets/images/banner/PDD.jpg">
        <p>- A plan-driven approach to software engineering is based around separate development stages with the outputs to be produced at each of these stages
          planned in advance.</p>
  
        <br>
  
        <h3>Agile methods</h3>
  
        <p>- Dissatisfaction with the overheads involved in software design methods of the 1980s and 1990s led to the creation of agile methods.</p>
  
        <br>
  
        <h3>Extreme Programming</h3>
  
        <p>- A very influential agile method, developed in the late 1990s, that introduced a range of agile development techniques.</p>
  
        <br>
  
        <h3>Refactoring</h3>
  
        <p>- Conventional wisdom in software engineering is to design for change.</p>
  
        <br>
  
        <h3>Test-First Development</h3>
  
        <p>- Testing is central to XP and XP has developed an approach where the program is tested after ever change has been made.</p>
  
        <br>
  
        <h3>Customer Involvement</h3>
  
        <p>- The role of the customer in the testing process is to help develop acceptance tests for the stories that are to be implemented in the next release
          of the system.</p>
  
         <br>
  
        <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
  
        <p>- Pair programming involves programmers working in pairs, developing code together.</p>
