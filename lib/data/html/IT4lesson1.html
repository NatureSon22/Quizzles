    <p>Software engineering is concerned with theories, methods and tools for professional software development.</p>
    <p>Expenditure on software represents a significant fraction of GNP in all developed countries.</p>
</div>

<br>   
            
<div>
    <h3>Software Cost</h3>
    <p>Software costs often dominate computer system costs. The costs of software on a PC are often greater than the hardware cost.</p>
    <p>Software costs more to maintain than it does to develop. For systems with a long life, maintenance costs may be several times development costs.</p>
</div>

<br>

<div>
    <h3>Software Project Failure</h3>
    <h3>1. Increasing system complexity</h3>
    <p>
        - As new software engineering techniques help us to build larger, more complex systems, the demands change. Systems have to be built and delivered more quickly; larger, even more complex systems are required; systems have to have new capabilities that were previously thought to be impossible
    </p>

    <h3>2. Failure to use software engineering methods</h3>
    <p>
        - It is fairly easy to write computer programs without using software engineering methods and techniques. Many companies have drifted into software development as their products and services have evolved.
    </p>
</div>

<br>

<div>
    <h3>Software Products</h3>
    <h3>1. Generic products</h3>
    <p>
        - Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them
    </p>

    <h3>2. Customized products</h3>
    <p>
        - Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own needs.
    </p>
</div>

<br>

<div>
    <h3>Software Process</h3>
    <p>- A structured set of activities required to develop a software system.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Many different software processes but all involve:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <strong>Specification</strong> U+2013 defining what the system should do.
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Design and implementation</strong> U+2013 defining what the system should do.
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Validation</strong> U+2013 checking that it does what the customer wants.
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Evolution</strong> U+2013 changing the system in response to changing customer needs.
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

<div>
    <h3>Software Process Models</h3>
    <h3>The Waterfall Model</h3>
    <p>
        - Plan-driven model. Separate and distinct phases of specification and development
    </p>

    <h3>Incremental Development</h3>
    <p>
        - Specification, development and validation are interleaved. May be plan- driven or agile.
    </p>

    <h3>Integration and configuration</h3>
    <p>
        - The system is assembled from existing configurable components. May be plan-driven or agile.
