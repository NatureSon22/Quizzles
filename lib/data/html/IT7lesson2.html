        Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.
    </p>
    <p>It's a key driver of AI applications, including natural language processing, image recognition, and recommendation systems.</p>

    <h3>Types of Machine Learning:</h3>
    <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
    <p>
        is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from input features to output labels based on example input-output pairs provided during training.

    <h3>Algorithms under Supervised Learning:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Linear Regression</li>
        <li>Logistic Regression</li>
        <li>Decision Trees</li>
        <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
        <li>Random Forests</li>
        <li>Naïve Bayes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
    <p>
        is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data. The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data.
    </p>

    <h3>Algorithms under Unsupervised Learning:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Autoencoders</li>
        <li>K-means Clustering</li>
        <li>Hierarchical Clustering</li>
        <li>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</li>
        <li>t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
    <p>
        is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent aims to maximize a cumulative reward signal over time by taking actions that lead to desirable outcomes and avoiding actions that lead to undesirable outcomes.
    </p>

    <h3>Algorithms under Reinforcement Learning:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Q-Learning</li>
        <li>Deep Q-Networks</li>
        <li>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</li>
        <li>Policy Gradient Methods</li>
        <li>Proximal Policy Optimization</li>
        <li>Actor-Critic Methods</li>
        <li>Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is GENETIC ALGORITHM?</h3>
    <p>
        A genetic algorithm (GA) is a type of optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. It is commonly used to solve optimization and search problems by mimicking the process of natural selection, where individuals with the fittest traits are more likely to survive and produce offspring.
    </p>

    <h3>What is FUZZY LOGIC?</h3>
    <p>
        Fuzzy Logic was introduced in 1965 by Lofti A. Zadeh in his research paper “Fuzzy Sets”. Fuzzy Logic resembles the human decision-making methodology. It deals with vague and imprecise information. This is gross oversimplification of the real-world problems and based on degrees of truth rather than usual true/false or 1/0 like Boolean logic.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE?</h3>
    <p>
        Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. The main objective of the SVM algorithm is to find the optimal hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that can separate the data points in different classes in the feature space.
